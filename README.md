Pick your platform
========================================

Pick your platform is an interactive that allows the reader to compare party positions on key issues. The issues are presented without party labelling so the reader is making their choices blindly, and at the end, there is a reveal that shows with which party the user is aligned. In spirit, this should be close to the Pick your platforms rolled out in NS and NB -- in that the writers pulled direct statements from the platforms and presented them as such. 


###Example:###
http://www.cbc.ca/elections/nsvotes2013/features/view/pick-your-platform



###Online package###
The multimedia feature consists of:

* A custom multiple choice quiz/poll that allows the user to select ONE position for each key issue and view results that show them which party their views are best aligned with.

* Broadcast strategy TBD

* Standard social media rollout plan, for the entire project and individual cases, will be developed in coordination with the Community Team.


###Content###
The primary content is managed in a Google Spreadsheet (GSS) and contains the issues, options, and party affilation of options.

Icons for specific topics will selected from Font Awesome or be stored in the gfx/ directory of the project root.

News stories, video and audio references (MPX) can be included in the structured GSS.




**Requirements**

* A spreadsheet driven template that would allow the writer to input the party positions.
* Five categories to compare platforms (ie. Energy, Health Care, Education, etc.) as well as space to present the stances on the platforms.
* As many as five parties (at present, there are no more than five for each province though these things can change, ie. We donâ€™t include the Green Party in Alta. in our My Election module for example, but if there were a sudden surge in popularity for that party we would need space for six. It would be great to have some flexibility on this consideration.)
* Design that works online (>= mobile)  and ideally integrated with broadcast rollout
* Responsive layout 
* Fed by cached CSV/json/text version of the spreadsheet
* Short URL for on-air throws



**Tasks**

* Review spreadsheet with editorial team input, identify core and ancillary fields to publish
* Clone a clean publishable worksheet
* Design the overall look
* Build logic in to muliple choice quiz template
* Reskin multiple choice quiz template
